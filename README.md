# Welcome to your project

## Getting started locally

1. Ensure you have Node.js and npm installed (nvm is recommended: [installation guide](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm#installing-and-updating)).
2. Clone the repository:  
   `git clone <YOUR_GIT_URL>`
3. Install dependencies:  
   `cd <YOUR_PROJECT_NAME> && npm install`
4. Run the development server with hot reload:  
   `npm run dev`

You can also edit files directly on GitHub or spin up a GitHub Codespace if you prefer a fully managed cloud IDE.

## Deployment

Use your preferred hosting provider for Vite/React applications (for example Vercel, Netlify, Render, or any static hosting that supports Node.js build steps). Build the project with `npm run build`, then deploy the generated `dist` directory.
